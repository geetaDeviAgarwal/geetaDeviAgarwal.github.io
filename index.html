<p>Geeta Devi Banwarilal Agarwal, a lifelong homemaker, DIY enthusiast and foodie,
passed away at 85 early on June 19th at her home in Surat. She had made lots and
lots of pickle, dal-baati, chutney, roti and other dishes throughout her life. A
lot of these recipes were perfected by her during her lifetime. She also was
involved in making a lot of dresses for laddu gopal (Krishna Idols) and crochet
purses among other DIY pursuits in her life.</p>

<p>She lived in Rajasthan, Warangal and Surat for major parts of her life. In each
of these places, she turned not only her house into a home, but did the same for
other people. From setting up marriages to helping raise kids, she was helpful
and charitable. She was the go-to reference for most of the family regarding the procedure for rituals.</p>

<p>She was an avid foodie. As far as her health allowed, Manchurian, garlic bread,
pizza, soups, pastas etc were heartily consumed. The only English she learnt was litreally the name of dishes she liked. In the two family functions, a month before
her passing, she met everyone and had almost all the cousins bring her a slice
of pizza each. She had learnt to eat with a fork and knife to enjoy these things
authentically.</p>

<p>She was also an accomplished cook. Despite her health, she insisted on cooking
the lunch as well as the morning tea. Occasionally and seasonally, she made
pickles and chutneys and panas.</p>

<p>She was obsessed with making dresses for laddu gopal during her 70s and made
hundreds of beautiful outfits. She learnt this skill from a variety of sources
and taught it to many others. She also learnt crochet during the same time and
made purses for almost all the women in the family.</p>

<p>She lived life to the fullest, eating and cooking food she loved till her last
day. Despite being widowed for 27 years, with the passing of her husband
Banwarilal Agarwal in 1998, she has been brave, resilient and hardworking.</p>

<p>Over the past 5 years, her health had deteriorated. While she was admitted a
few times, it was never very serious. She was not bedridden for a single day in
her life. She suffered from depression and anxiety along with other old age
based mind disorders; which she faced with her characteristic strength and grit.
However, when the end came, she died of natural causes in her sleep. She is
survived by a huge family, blood and otherwise, she has cultivated over the
years, including her 3 daughters and 2 sons: Kausalya, Manju, Krishna and
Maluram, Maneesh; their spouses, grandchildren as well as family on her
husband’s side; along with co-workers of her family who enjoyed her homemade
tiffins, friends of her grandchildren who enjoyed her hospitality and colleagues
she met at the temple who enjoyed her company.</p>
