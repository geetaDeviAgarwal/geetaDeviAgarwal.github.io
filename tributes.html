	    <p><em>Arjun Maneesh Agarwal</em><br>
	      <em>Grandson</em></p>

	    <p>
      I have been roommates with my grandmother for 10ish years(like almost
      exactly 10 years). As my both parents are working, even before I lived in
      her room, she raised me from almost since I was born till 3/4 years. I
      literally called her maa.</p>
      
      <p>I normally sleep quite heavily. Like the only way I wake up is when maa
      shuts the fan for Pooja or when she wakes me up as my alarm is ringing.
      Like she wakes up before my father, makes the tea and wakes him up. That
      morning, I woke up to alarm and she is asleep. I get worried and try to
      wake her up and that was that.</p>

      <p>Like I and maa used to speak seldomly since 3ish years, after her mental
      health detoriated to the point where she would repeat the same thing over
      and over, and as I was studying first in Ahmedabad and then Surat. Like I
      am asking about how her health is and she will keep saying that I should
      drink milk. But the thing was, we used to still stay in the same room as
      and when I was in Surat.</p>

      <p>While I have had more roomates since then, she was by far the best and
      I will forever cherish the time I had with her. May her soul rest in
      peace.</p>
